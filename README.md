luess
=====

luess is a R package for estimation of ecosystem services based on LPJmL model output. In its early state at the moment
it provides functions to re-project CLUMondo model output to other geographic projections and to aggregrate CLUMondo 
grid cells to any other grid.

It is intended to add further functionality to translate CLUMondo land use systems to LPJmL crop functional types and for
returning ready to use LPJmL input files.

The main purpose of the package will be to provide functions to derive and quantify ecosystem services from LPJmL model
output after driving it using translated CLUMondo model output.
